Project Tori
############

:Language: Python 2.7 / 3.3+

Tori is a light-weight framework based on and compatible with the latest stable
release of Facebookâ€™s Tornado Framework.

It simply aims to simplify the bootstraping process for Tornado Framework and
provide commonly procedures (or sub-routines) in order to solve problems, e.g.
``tori.db`` for object-to-document and object relational mapping. This library
is available via ``pip`` or the old-school ``easy_install``.
